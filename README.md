# FaceRecognition-face_recognition
## Introduction
  - This project uses face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces. This is the simplest face recognition library developed by Adam Geitgey. 
  - This library was built using dlib with deep learning. Dlib is a C++ toolkit which contains machine learning algorithms and other useful tools. 
  - With an accuracy of 99.38% it performs well in recognizing faces. The package also provides a command line tool which can be easily used to compare two images from a given path.
  -  A sample snippet of the code which uses face_recognition on two images: known.jpg and unknown.jpg:
